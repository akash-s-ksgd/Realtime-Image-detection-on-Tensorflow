Real-Time Image Detection Using TensorFlow
This project performs real-time image detection using TensorFlow, a Flask backend, and a web-based frontend.

🚀 Features
Detects and recognizes objects via a webcam.

Saves recognized objects in a JSON storage.

Fully web-based frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Backend powered by Flask and TensorFlow.

Works on any device with dependencies installed.

🛠️ Installation & Setup
✅ 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

sh
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
cd YOUR_REPO
✅ 2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment
Since TensorFlow requires a proper environment, create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

sh
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
✅ 3️⃣ Activate the Virtual Environment
Depending on your OS, activate the environment:

Windows (Command Prompt):

sh
Copy
Edit
venv\Scripts\activate
Windows (PowerShell):

sh
Copy
Edit
.\venv\Scripts\Activate
Mac/Linux:

sh
Copy
Edit
source venv/bin/activate
✅ 4️⃣ Install Dependencies
Install all required dependencies using:

sh
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
✅ 5️⃣ Run the Backend
Start the Flask backend server:

sh
Copy
Edit
python app.py
It should display output like:

nginx
Copy
Edit
Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
✅ 6️⃣ Run the Frontend
Now, start a simple HTTP server for the frontend.

Navigate to the frontend folder:

sh
Copy
Edit
cd frontend
Start the frontend server:

Using Python (Recommended):

sh
Copy
Edit
python -m http.server 8000
Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

🛠️ Troubleshooting
If pip install -r requirements.txt fails, ensure Python & pip are updated.

If the webcam doesn’t open, check browser permissions.

If Flask doesn’t start, try:

sh
Copy
Edit
flask run
If TensorFlow throws errors, ensure you're using a compatible Python version (3.8+ recommended).
